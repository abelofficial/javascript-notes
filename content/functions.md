# Functions

A function isa set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. A function is like a "subprogram" that can be **called** by external or internal (in the case of recursion)code. Every function in JavaScript is a Function object. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
